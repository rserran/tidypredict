[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tidymodels/tidypredict.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tidymodels/tidypredict)
[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/tidypredict)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidypredict)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidypredict)
library(randomForest)
```


The main goal of `tidypredict` is to enable running predictions inside databases. It reads the model, extracts the components needed to calculate the prediction, and then creates an R formula that can be translated into SQL. In other words, it is able to parse a model such as this one:

```{r}
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)
```

`tidypredict` can return a SQL statement that is ready to run inside the database.  Because it uses `dplyr`'s database interface, it works with several databases back-ends, such as MS SQL:

```{r}
tidypredict_sql(model, dbplyr::simulate_mssql())
```


## Installation

Install `tidypredict` from CRAN using:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidypredict")
```

Or install the **development version** using `devtools` as follows:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tidymodels/tidypredict")
```

## How it works

<img src="man/figures/howitworks.png">

Instead of translating directly to a SQL statement, `tidypredict` creates an R formula. That formula can then be used inside `dplyr`.  The overall workflow would be as illustrated in the image above, and described here:

1. Fit the model using a base R model, or one from the packages listed in [Supported Models](#supported-models)
1. `tidypredict` reads model, and creates a list object with the necessary components to run predictions
1. `tidypredict` builds an R formula based on the list object
1. `dplyr` evaluates the formula created by `tidypredict`
1. `dplyr` translates the formula into a SQL statement, or any other interfaces.
1. The database executes the SQL statement(s) created by `dplyr`

### Parsed model spec

`tidypredict` writes and reads a spec based on a model.  Instead of simply writing the R formula directly, splitting the spec from the formula adds the following capabilities:

1. No more saving models as `.rds` - Specifically for cases when the model needs to be used for predictions in a Shiny app.
1. Beyond R models - Technically, anything that can write a proper spec, can be read into `tidypredict`. It also means, that the parsed model spec can become a good alternative to using *PMML.*

## Supported models

The following models are supported by `tidypredict`:

- Linear Regression - `lm()`
- Generalized Linear model - `glm()`
- Random Forest models - `randomForest::randomForest()`
- Random Forest models, via `ranger` - `ranger::ranger()`
- MARS models - `earth::earth()`
- XGBoost models - `xgboost::xgb.Booster.complete()` **[In development version]**
- Cubist models - `Cubist::cubist()` **[In development version]**
- Tree models, via `partykit` - `partykit::ctree()` **[In development version]**

### `parsnip` **[In development version]** 

`tidypredict` supports models fitted via the `parsnip` interface. The ones confirmed currently work in `tidypredict` are:

- `lm()` - `parsnip`: `linear_reg()` with *"lm"* as the engine.
- `randomForest::randomForest()` - `parsnip`: `rand_forest()` with *"randomForest"* as the engine.
- `ranger::ranger()` - `parsnip`: `rand_forest()` with *"ranger"* as the engine.
- `earth::earth()`  - `parsnip`: `mars()` with *"earth"* as the engine.
